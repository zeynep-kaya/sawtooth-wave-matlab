Graph1(top left): Plot a sawtooth wave with a fundamental frequency of 10Hz lasting for 2 seconds(Hint: MATLAB has a command for creating such a signal).

Graph2(top right): Plot the frequency spectrum of the signal in Graph1.
A sawtooth wave can be expressed as a sum of Fourier Series as follows:
s(t)=2/π [sin⁡〖(ω_1 t)-〗  1/2  sin⁡〖(2ω_1 t)〗+1/3  sin⁡〖(3ω_1 t)〗-1/4  sin⁡〖(4ω_1 t)〗+1/5  sin⁡〖(5ω_1 t)〗…]
Where ω_1=2πf_1 is the fundamental angular frequency of the sawtooth wave.

Graph3(bottom left): Plot the sawtooth wave as a sum of n sinusoids(You can choose the value of n, but it must be larger than 5).

Graph4(bottom right): Plot the frequency spectrum of the signal in Graph3, just like you did in Graph2
